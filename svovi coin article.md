### **Key Features of Snovi Coin**

#### **1. Simple Registration with Wallet Address Only**
To access Snovi Coin, there’s no need for complex and personal information. Registration is simplified to just a **wallet address**. This approach allows users to participate without sharing sensitive personal details, enhancing privacy and security.

#### **2. Transaction Assurance through Smart Contracts**
Snovi Coin utilizes **smart contracts** to ensure transactions are held in escrow until all conditions of the trade are fulfilled. This system works as follows:

- **Buyer Payment:** When a buyer makes a payment, the funds are held in a smart contract and will only be released when the seller sends the cryptocurrency to the buyer’s wallet address.
- **Crypto Transfer to Buyer’s Address:** After payment, the seller transfers the cryptocurrency to the buyer’s wallet address. This step is managed automatically by the system.
- **Confirmation and Fund Release to Seller:** The smart contract checks whether the cryptocurrency has been sent to the buyer's wallet address. Upon confirmation, the funds are automatically released to the seller's account.
- **Refund Process in Case of Non-Delivery:** If the seller fails to send the cryptocurrency within a specified time frame, the smart contract automatically refunds the buyer’s payment.

#### **3. High Security with Distributed Data**
One of the standout features of Snovi Coin is its high-security level. Even if a hacker manages to access the Snovi Coin server, they will not be able to compromise the data. The server is designed to distribute information like puzzle pieces across thousands of locations worldwide. To successfully hack Snovi Coin, a hacker must gather thousands of data pieces from various locations around the globe. This strategy makes attacking the Snovi Coin server not only time-consuming but also incredibly challenging and impractical.

#### **4. Central Server for Transaction Management**
Snovi Coin also utilizes a central server that oversees and manages transactions. This server is connected to the blockchain and acts as a mediator. Its responsibilities include:

- **Verifying Transaction Validity:** Ensuring that the cryptocurrency is accurately transferred to the buyer’s wallet.
- **Controlling Transaction Timelines:** Approving transactions only when all conditions have been met.
- **Resolving Disputes:** Handling any conflicts that may arise between buyers and sellers.

#### **5. Lower Costs and Higher Speed through Scalability Technology**
Snovi Coin leverages advanced scalability technologies and layer-two networks to minimize transaction costs and significantly increase transaction speeds. This feature makes Snovi Coin suitable for both small and large transactions occurring simultaneously.
